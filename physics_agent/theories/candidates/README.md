# Candidate Theories Directory

This directory contains candidate gravitational theories generated by the self-discovery system that have shown promising results but have not yet been peer-reviewed and published.

## Directory Structure

Each candidate theory is stored in a directory with the naming convention:
```
c_{timestamp}_{hash}/
```

Where:
- `timestamp`: When the candidate was discovered (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
- `hash`: 8-character cryptographic hash of the theory code

## Candidate Lifecycle

1. **Discovery**: Generated by the self-discovery agent
2. **Testing**: Evaluated against baselines and existing theories
3. **Promotion**: If scoring in top 10, promoted to candidate status
4. **Review**: Community review via pull requests
5. **Graduation**: After peer review and publication, moved to main theories/ directory

## Testing Candidates

To run all candidates along with regular theories:
```bash
albert run --candidates
```

To test only candidate theories:
```bash
albert run --candidates-only
```

To test candidates with a specific status:
```bash
albert run --candidates --candidates-status new     # Only new candidates
albert run --candidates --candidates-status rejected # Include rejected ones
```

To test a specific candidate:
```bash
albert run --theory-filter "c_20240115_abc12345"
```

## Contributing Candidates

If you discover a promising candidate:

1. The self-discovery system will automatically create the candidate directory
2. Follow the PR instructions displayed when a candidate scores in the top 10
3. Submit a pull request with your candidate for community review

## Candidate Requirements

Each candidate directory should contain:
- `theory.py`: The theory implementation
- `README.md`: Description and discovery context
- Run results from the initial evaluation
- Any validation data that demonstrates the theory's promise

## Review Process

Candidates remain in this directory until:
1. They are validated by the community
2. Published in a peer-reviewed journal
3. Then moved to the appropriate category in the main theories/ directory

This ensures a clear separation between experimental candidates and established theories.
