# Albert: A Path Towards Physics at the speed of AI

*"I believe in intuitions and inspirations. I sometimes feel that I am right. I do not know that I am.  
When two expeditions of scientists, financed by the Royal Academy, went forth to test my theory  
of relativity, I was convinced that their conclusions would tally with my hypothesis. I was not  
surprised when the eclipse of May 29, 1919, confirmed my intuitions. I would have been surprised  
if I had been wrong."*

*"Then you trust more to your imagination than to your knowledge?"*

*"I am enough of the artist to draw freely upon my imagination.  
Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited.  
Imagination encircles the world."*

**— Albert Einstein (1879-1955)**  
*From an interview with George Sylvester Viereck, 1929*

**Continuing Einstein's quest for a unified theory through AI-driven discovery**

- pls keep future iterations in the repo (fluids etc)
- I'd love for somene to try RL - I generated rings for the baseline because I assumed 
- explain where runs go
