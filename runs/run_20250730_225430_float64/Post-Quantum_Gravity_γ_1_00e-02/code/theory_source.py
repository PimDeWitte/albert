    Post-Quantum Gravity: Recent theory unifying gravity and quantum mechanics without quantizing gravity.
    
    Preserves Einstein's spacetime while modifying quantum measurement postulates.
    Classical gravity induces random fluctuations in quantum systems.
    
    Category: quantum (classical gravity + modified quantum mechanics)
    
    Parameters:
    - gamma_pqg: Coupling strength for gravity-induced collapse
    
    Lagrangian: Standard GR + quantum fields, but with stochastic collapse terms.
    
    Metric: Standard Schwarzschild, but theory predicts deviations in quantum tests near horizons.

    Additional source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02285-4 (Oppenheim's paper on post-quantum gravity)
    
    Novel predictions:
    - Gravity-induced objective collapse of wavefunctions
    - No quantum gravity at Planck scale; gravity remains classical
    - Testable deviations in interference experiments under gravity
    
    Quantum effects: Modified quantum dynamics due to classical gravity fluctuations.
