# Unified Gauge Model (UGM) - Partanen & Tulkki (2025)

## Overview

This implementation follows the groundbreaking framework from Partanen & Tulkki's 2025 paper "Gravity generated by four one-dimensional unitary gauge symmetries and the Standard Model". The key insight is that gravity emerges naturally from four U(1) gauge symmetries—the same mathematical structure underlying electromagnetism.

## Mathematical Framework

### Core Concept

Instead of treating gravity as a single tensor field, UGM represents it as four independent Abelian gauge theories:

- **Gauge Potentials**: $H^a_\mu(x)$ where $a = 0, 1, 2, 3$ (one for each tetrad index)
- **Tetrad Construction**: $e^a_\mu(x) = \delta^a_\mu + g H^a_\mu(x)$
- **Metric Recovery**: $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab} e^a_\mu e^b_\nu$

### Field Dynamics

The gravitational Lagrangian consists of four U(1) sectors:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{1}{4} \sum_{a=0}^3 \alpha_a F^a_{\mu\nu} F^{a\mu\nu}$$

where $F^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu H^a_\nu - \partial_\nu H^a_\mu$ are the standard Abelian field strengths.

## Implementation Details

### Theory Class: `UnifiedGaugeModel`

```python
from physics_agent.theories.ugm import UnifiedGaugeModel

# Create UGM instance with custom parameters
ugm = UnifiedGaugeModel(
    alpha0=1.0,  # Time U(1) coupling
    alpha1=1.0,  # Radial U(1) coupling  
    alpha2=1.0,  # Theta U(1) coupling
    alpha3=1.0,  # Phi U(1) coupling
    g_coupling=0.1  # Universal gauge coupling
)
```

### Key Features

1. **Four Independent Couplings**: Each U(1) sector has its own weight $\alpha_a$
2. **Weak-Field Approximation**: Gauge fields initialized to recover Schwarzschild in appropriate limit
3. **Full Tetrad Formalism**: Metric computed from tetrads via $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab} e^a_\mu e^b_\nu$
4. **PyTorch Integration**: All operations use differentiable tensors with autograd support

### Parameter Space

The theory has 5 key parameters:
- `alpha0` through `alpha3`: Weights for each U(1) sector (default: 1.0)
- `g_coupling`: Universal gauge coupling strength (default: 0.1)

Different combinations produce distinct gravitational signatures:
- Equal alphas → approaches General Relativity
- Enhanced `alpha0` → stronger time dilation effects
- Enhanced `alpha1` → modified radial gradients

## Physical Predictions

### Novel Features

1. **Renormalizability**: Unlike GR, UGM is renormalizable due to its gauge structure
2. **Unification**: Seamlessly integrates with Standard Model gauge fields
3. **Modified Dispersion**: Quantum corrections modify photon propagation near horizons
4. **Four-fold Structure**: Gravity has internal degrees of freedom from the four U(1)s

### Experimental Tests

The theory can be tested through:
- Precision orbit measurements (Mercury precession, PSR timing)
- Light deflection with energy dependence
- Gravitational wave polarization modes
- Quantum interference experiments in gravitational fields

## Usage Example

```python
import torch
from physics_agent.theories.ugm import UnifiedGaugeModel
from physics_agent.geodesic_integrator import UGMGeodesicRK4Solver

# Create theory instance
theory = UnifiedGaugeModel(alpha0=1.2, alpha1=0.8, alpha2=1.0, alpha3=1.0)

# Set up geodesic solver
M_phys = 1.989e30  # Solar mass in kg
solver = UGMGeodesicRK4Solver(theory, M_phys, enable_quantum_corrections=True)

# Integrate geodesics
# ... (standard geodesic integration workflow)
```

## Weak-Field Limit

In the weak-field approximation around a spherical mass:
- $H^0_0 \approx GM/(rc^2g)$ generates time dilation
- $H^1_1 \approx -GM/(rc^2g)$ generates spatial curvature
- $H^2_2, H^3_3 \approx 0$ for spherical symmetry
- Off-diagonal terms vanish for static case

This recovers the Schwarzschild metric when all $\alpha_a = 1$.

## Future Extensions

1. **Rotating Sources**: Include $H^0_3$ terms for frame-dragging
2. **Charged Sources**: Couple electromagnetic U(1) to gravitational U(1)s
3. **Cosmological Solutions**: Extend to FLRW-like metrics
4. **Strong-Field Regime**: Numerical solutions beyond weak-field
