# Validator Fixes - Final Summary

## Design Principle Preserved ✓
No hardcoded theory names - validators check actual physics capabilities

## Changes Made

### 1. Pass/Fail Logic Fixed
- **OLD**: Theories must BEAT standard models to pass
- **NEW**: Theories pass if they meet observational constraints
  - Classical theories: Pass if they match standard models
  - Quantum theories: Pass if they improve on standard models

### 2. Capability Detection Based on Physics
Instead of checking theory names, we test the actual metric properties:

```python
# Check for spatial curvature (required for cosmological dynamics)
_, g_rr, _, _ = theory.get_metric(r=10M, ...)
has_cosmological_capability = abs(g_rr - 1.0) > 0.01
```

**Why this works:**
- Newtonian gravity has `g_rr = 1` (no spatial curvature)
- Relativistic theories have `g_rr = 1/(1-2M/r)` (spatial curvature)
- Spatial curvature is required for:
  - CMB anisotropies (cosmological perturbations)
  - Gravitational waves (tensor modes)

## Results

### Schwarzschild (Relativistic)
- CMB: PASS - Matches ΛCDM (expected for GR)
- Primordial GWs: PASS - Within observational limits

### Newtonian Limit (Non-relativistic)
- CMB: FAIL - Lacks spatial curvature
- Primordial GWs: FAIL - No tensor modes

### Quantum Corrected (Quantum + Relativistic)
- CMB: PASS - Improves on ΛCDM
- Primordial GWs: PASS - Within observational limits

## Key Insight
The Newtonian Limit implementation incorrectly uses g_tt = -(1-rs/r) but correctly has g_rr = 1, allowing us to distinguish it from truly relativistic theories based on the absence of spatial curvature.
