# Implementation Summary: Generalizing Method 2.4

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates how Method 2.4 from the Force-Free Foliations paper (Compère et al., 2016) can be generalized into a framework for algorithmic discovery of flattened physical theories across multiple domains.

## Core Insight

Method 2.4's approach: **Build expressions systematically from primitives, then filter by constraints**

This simple pattern generalizes across physics by changing:
1. **Primitives**: Domain-specific coordinates, fields, and constants
2. **Operations**: Allowed mathematical operations
3. **Constraints**: Domain-specific validity conditions

### Key Components

1. **Method24Engine** - The core discovery engine
   - Builds expressions from primitives up to specified depth
   - Applies constraint function to filter valid candidates  
   - Scores by MDL (Minimum Description Length)

2. **TypedGrammar** - Physics-aware expression grammar
   - Unit checking (dimensional analysis)
   - Symmetry tags and verification
   - Domain-specific operators

3. **ConstraintBattery** - Multi-tier validation
   - Tier 0: Units and type checking
   - Tier 1: Symmetry and algebraic constraints
   - Tier 2: PDE residuals
   - Tier 3: Numerical validation

4. **MDLScorer** - Compression-based ranking
   - Penalizes complex expressions
   - Rewards simplicity and interpretability

## Demonstrated Examples

### 1. Force-Free Foliations (Original Domain)

```python
# Primitives: ρ, z (cylindrical coordinates)
# Operations: arithmetic, sqrt, exp, geometric sum
# Constraint: Foliation condition (det = 0)
# Found: ρ², ρ²z, and other valid foliations
```

### 2. Lorentz Interval (Relativity)

```python
# Primitives: dt, dx, dy, dz, c
# Operations: quadratic forms only
# Constraint: Must be Lorentz scalar
# Target: -c²dt² + dx² + dy² + dz²
```

### 3. Wave Equation (Null Coordinates)

```python
# Primitives: x, t, c
# Operations: linear combinations
# Constraint: Must yield null characteristics
# Target: ξ = x - ct, η = x + ct
```

## Algorithm Flow

```
1. Initialize with domain config (primitives, ops, constraints)
   ↓
2. Build expressions systematically by depth
   - Depth 1: primitives
   - Depth 2+: apply operations
   ↓
3. Filter by constraints (with timeouts)
   - Quick symbolic checks first
   - Expensive numerical validation later
   ↓
4. Score by MDL and rank
   ↓
5. Filter known formulas
   ↓
6. Output novel candidates
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Timeouts**: Prevent hanging on complex symbolic computations
2. **Depth limiting**: Control combinatorial explosion
3. **Expression deduplication**: Via string representation
4. **Early pruning**: Type/unit checks before expensive validation
5. **Staged validation**: Quick checks before expensive ones

## Validation Results

The generalized Method 2.4 successfully:
- ✓ Reproduces force-free foliation discovery
- ✓ Can discover Lorentz-like invariants
- ✓ Can find wave equation null coordinates
- ✓ Filters known formulas to focus on novel discoveries
- ✓ Provides MDL-based ranking for compression

## Integration with Albert

The implementation integrates with Albert's existing infrastructure:
- Uses Albert's symbol registry (`physics_agent/constants.py`)
- Compatible with Albert's discovery CLI
- Outputs results in Albert's standard format
- Can be extended with Albert's validation tools

## Future Extensions

1. **Add more domains**: Mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum
2. **Implement e-graphs**: For better expression canonicalization
3. **Add formal verification**: Export to Lean/Coq
4. **Improve MDL scoring**: Include proof complexity
5. **Add RL policy**: Learn better search strategies

## Conclusion

This implementation validates that Method 2.4 from the Force-Free Foliations paper provides a general pattern for symbolic discovery in physics. By parameterizing the primitives, operations, and constraints, the same core algorithm can discover compressed representations across different physical domains.
