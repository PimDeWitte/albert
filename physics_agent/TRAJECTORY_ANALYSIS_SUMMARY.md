# Trajectory Analysis Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Verified Trajectory Accuracy
- **Finding**: Trajectories are correct! Particles orbit at r ≈ 7.426e-12 m (10M for primordial mini black hole)
- **Issue resolved**: Initial confusion was due to the extremely small scale - this radius appears as "nearly zero" but is actually 10 Schwarzschild radii (5 Rs)
- **Confirmation**: Particles show proper circular orbits with angular motion, moving at ~0.3c

### 2. ✅ Built Early Detection System
- Created `TrajectoryMonitor` class in `early_termination_detector.py`
- Detects:
  - Horizon crossing (r < 2.1M)
  - Escape to infinity (r > 1000M)  
  - Stuck particles (motion < threshold)
- Can be integrated into trajectory calculations for efficiency

### 3. ✅ Fixed NumPy Gradient Warnings
- **Issue**: Yukawa theory showed divide-by-zero warnings in `np.gradient()`
- **Solution**: Implemented safe gradient calculation in trajectory visualization
- **Result**: No more warnings during visualization generation

### 4. ✅ Created Comprehensive Trajectory Visualizations
- Generated beautiful multi-panel plots for all 15 theories showing:
  - 3D trajectories with start/end points
  - X-Y orbital views with key radii (horizon, photon sphere, ISCO)
  - Radial evolution over time (r vs t)
  - Polar plots (r vs φ)
  - Phase space diagrams (r vs dr/dt)
  - Detailed statistics panel
- Saved in `physics_agent/trajectory_visualizations/`
- Created HTML index for easy browsing

### 5. ✅ Integrated Visualizations into Reports
- Updated comprehensive test report generator
- Added links to trajectory visualizations:
  - 📊 Full trajectory analysis (multi-panel view)
  - 🌐 Clean orbit plot (X-Y view)
  - 🚀 Interactive 3D viewer (for multi-particle runs)

### 6. ✅ Created Particle Configurations
- Added particle configuration files for all theories
- Ensures compatibility with multi-particle trajectory simulations
- Created 20 new particle directories for quantum theories

## Key Insights

### Trajectory Scale for Primordial Mini Black Holes
- Mass: 1.0e15 kg (5.03e-16 solar masses)
- Schwarzschild radius: 1.485e-12 m
- 10M orbital radius: 7.426e-12 m
- Orbital period: ~4.9e-19 s
- Typical speeds: ~0.3c

### Visualization Features
Each theory now has comprehensive trajectory visualizations showing:
1. How particles orbit in 3D space
2. Comparison with key radii (horizon, photon sphere, ISCO)
3. Time evolution of radial coordinate
4. Angular motion and number of orbits completed
5. Phase space behavior
6. Statistical summary of motion

## Usage

### View Trajectory Visualizations
1. Open the HTML index:
   ```
   open physics_agent/trajectory_visualizations/index.html
   ```

2. Or view individual theory plots:
   ```
   open physics_agent/trajectory_visualizations/Schwarzschild_trajectory.png
   ```

3. Access via comprehensive report:
   ```
   open physics_agent/reports/latest_comprehensive_validation.html
   ```

### Run New Trajectory Tests
```python
# Quick trajectory test
python physics_agent/test_trajectory_motion_fixed.py

# Regenerate all visualizations
python physics_agent/generate_theory_trajectory_plots.py

# Full comprehensive test with reports
python physics_agent/test_comprehensive_final.py
```

## Notes on Warnings

The "No particle data found" warnings during comprehensive tests are harmless. They occur because:
- The comprehensive test runs single-particle trajectories
- The multi-particle viewer looks for multiple particle trajectories in run directories
- These warnings can be ignored - they don't affect the test results or visualizations
