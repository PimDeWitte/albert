# Trajectory Debugging Final Summary

## What We Fixed ✅

1. **Unit Conversion Bug**: Removed incorrect scaling of phi as velocity
2. **State Format Confusion**: Fixed conversions between different 4D formats
3. **Initial State**: Now correctly sets theta=π/2
4. **Distance Calculation**: Added to test and report table

## Current Status

```
Step 0: t=0.000, r=0.000, theta=1.571, phi=0.000
Step 1: t=0.000, r=0.000, theta=1.571, phi=-457433606581579424729137152.000
```

### What's Working ✓
- r = 7.426e-12 meters (correct: 10M for primordial black hole)
- theta = 1.571 (correct: π/2 for equatorial motion)
- Initial state is correct

### What's Still Broken ✗
- phi values explode to ~1e28 after first step
- This appears to be coming from the solver itself

## Root Cause Analysis

The ConservedQuantityGeodesicSolver is producing these huge phi values. This could be due to:

1. **Numerical Instability**: The primordial black hole has extremely small scales
   - Length scale: 7.4e-13 meters
   - Time scale: 2.5e-21 seconds
   - These tiny values may cause numerical overflow

2. **Solver Bug**: The solver might have an issue with the phi evolution equation

3. **Wrong Parameters**: The solver might be using incorrect conserved quantities (E, L)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test with Larger Black Hole**: Use a stellar-mass black hole instead of primordial
2. **Debug Solver Directly**: Step through ConservedQuantityGeodesicSolver.rk4_step()
3. **Check Conserved Quantities**: Verify E and L values are reasonable
4. **Consider Double Precision**: Ensure all calculations use float64

## Impact on WebGL Visualization

Until phi values are fixed:
- Trajectories will appear corrupted
- Distance calculations will be wrong
- Visualization will not show proper orbits

The WebGL viewer is ready and waiting for valid trajectory data!
